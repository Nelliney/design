                <p> Iâ€™m a digital designer and front-end developer. I specialize in producing simple meaningful solutions to a variety of digital tasks, adopting a user-centered approach to develop beautiful and useable interfaces for web and mobile. Here, I am responsible for the full lifecycle development of next-generation software, from initial gathering requirements to design, coding, unit testing. In my free time, I like to take pictures of people, architecture, and nature. If you need any portfolio for your business, I can do it for you on a high level.

                <p> For creating a new website or making a website redesign I start the process with research and planning to ensure the most appropriate design response. Starting with wireframes, then I define the visual direction of your website. The development process ensures the website loads fast and performs perfectly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
